--- abstract

The Homenet Naming authority is responsible for making devices within
the home network accessible by name within the home network as well as
from outside the home network (e.g. the Internet). The names of the
devices accessible from the Internet are stored in the Public Homenet
Zone, served by a DNS authoritative server. It is unlikely that home
networks will contain sufficiently robust platforms designed to host a
service such as the DNS on the Internet and as such would expose the
home network to DDoS attacks.

This document describes a mechanism that enables the Home Network
Authority (HNA) to outsource the naming service to the Outsourcing
Infrastructure via a Distribution Master (DM).

#Introduction

The Homenet Naming authority is responsible for making devices within
the home network accessible by name within the home network as well as
from outside the home network (e.g. the Internet).  IPv6 connectivity
provides for provides the possibility of global end to end IP connectivity.
End users will be able to transparently make use of this connectivity if
they can use names to access the services they want from their home network.

The use of a DNS zone for each home network is a reasonable and scalable way
to make the set of public names visible.
There are a number of ways to populate such a zone.
This specification proposes a way to do with based upon a number of
assumptions about typical home networks.

1. The names of the devices accessible from the Internet are stored in the
   Public Homenet Zone, served by a DNS authoritative server.

2. It is unlikely that home networks will contain sufficiently robust
   platforms designed to host a service such as the DNS on the Internet and as
   such would expose the home network to DDoS attacks.

3. {{!RFC7368}} emphazes that the home network is subject to connectivity
   disruptions with the ISP.
   But, names used within the home MUST be resilient against such disruption.

So a goal of this specification is to make the public names resolvable within
both the home network and on the Internet, even when there are disruptions.

This is achieved by having a device inside the home network that builds,
publishes, and manages a Public Homenet Zone, thus providing bindings
between public names, IP addresses, and other RR types.

The management of the names can be a role that the Customer Premises
Equipment (CPE) does.
Other devices in the home network could fulfill this role e.g. a NAS server,
but for simplicity, this document assumes the function is located on one of the CPE devices.

The homenet architecture {{!RFC7368}} makes it clear that a home network may have multiple CPEs.
The management of the Public Homenet Zone involves DNS specific mechanisms
that cannot be distributed over multiple servers (primary server), when
multiple nodes can potentially manage the Public Homenet Zone, a single node
needs to be selected per outsourced zone.
This selected node is designated as providing the Homenet Naming Authority (HNA) function.

The process by which a single HNA is selected per zone is not in scope for this document.
It is envisioned that a future document will describe an HNCP mechanism to elect the single HNA.

CPEs, which may host the HNA function, as well as home network devices, are usually low powered devices not designed for terminating heavy traffic.
As a result, hosting an authoritative DNS service visible to the Internet may expose the home network to resource exhaustion and other attacks.
Additionally, the names could become unavailable during disruptions of the upstream Internet connectivity.

In order to avoid resource exhaustion and other attacks, this document
describes an architecture that outsources the authoritative naming
service of the home network. More specifically, the HNA builds the
Public Homenet Zone and  outsources it to an Outsourcing Infrastructure
via a Distribution Master (DM). The Outsourcing Infrastructure is in
charge of publishing the corresponding Public Homenet Zone on the
Internet. The transfer of DNS zone information is achieved using
standard DNS mechanisms involving primary and secondary DNS servers,
with the HNA hosted primary being a stealth primary, and the
Distribution Master a secondary.

{{sec-arch-overview}} provides an architecture description that
describes the relation between the HNA and the Outsourcing Architecture.
In order to keep the Public Homenet Zone up-to-date {{sec-synch}}
describes how the HNA and the Outsourcing Infrastructure synchronizes
the Pubic Homenet Zone.

The proposed architecture is explicitly designed to enable fully
functional DNSSEC, and the Public Homenet Zone is expected to be signed
with a secure delegation.  DNSSEC key management and zone signing is
handled by the HNA.

{{sec-reverse}} discusses management of one or more reverse zones.
{{sec-renumbering}} discusses how renumbering should be handled.
Finally, {{sec-privacy}} and {{sec-security}} respectively discuss
privacy and security considerations when outsourcing the Public Homenet
Zone.

The Public Homenet Zone is expected to contain public information only
in a single universal view.  This document does not define how the
information required to construct this view is derived.

It is also not in the scope of this document to define names for
exclusive use within the boundaries of the local home network. Instead,
local scope information is expected to be provided to the home network
using local scope naming services. mDNS {{!RFC6762}}, DNS-SD {{-DNS-SD}}
are two examples of these services. Currently mDNS is limited to a
single link network. However, future protocols and architectures
{{?I-D.ietf-homenet-simple-naming}} are expected to leverage this
constraint as pointed out in {{!RFC7558}}.

## Alternative solutions

An alternative existing solution in IPv4 is to have a single zone, where
a host uses a RESTful HTTP service to register a single name into a
common public zone.  This is often called "Dynamic DNS", and there are a
number of commercial providers, including Dyn, Gandi etc. These
solutions were typically used by a host behind the CPE to make it's CPE
IPv4 address visible, usually in order to enable incoming connections.

For a small number (one to three) of hosts, use of such a system
provides an alternative to the architecture described in this document.

The alternative does suffer from some severe limitations:

* the CPE/HNA router is unaware of the process, and cannot respond to
queries for these names when there are disruptions in connectivity. This
makes the home user or application dependent on having to resolve
different names in the event of outages or disruptions.

* the CPE/HNA router cannot control the process. Any host can do this
regardless of whether or not the home network administrator wants the
name published or not. There is therefore no possible audit trail.

* the credentials for the dynamic DNS server need to be securely transferred
to all hosts that wish to use it. This is not a problem for a technical
user to do with one or two hosts, but it does not scale to multiple
hosts and becomes a problem for non-technical users.

* "all the good names are taken" -- current services put everyone's names
into some small set of zones, and there are often conflicts.
Distinguishing similar names by delegation of zones was among the
primary design goals of the DNS system.

* The RESTful services do not always support all RR types. The homenet user
is dependent on the service provider supporting new types. By providing full
DNS delegation, this document enables all RR types and also future extensions.

There is no technical reason why a RESTful cloud service could not
provide solutions to many of these problems, but this document describes
a DNS based solution.

#Terminology

{::boilerplate bcp14}

* Customer Premises Equipment: (CPE) is a router providing connectivity
to the home network.

* Homenet Zone: is the DNS zone for use within the boundaries of the
home network: home.arpa, see {{!RFC8375}}). This zone is not considered
public and is out of scope for this document.

* Registered Homenet Domain: is the Domain Name associated with the home
network.

* Public Homenet Zone: contains the names in the home network that are
expected to be publicly resolvable on the Internet.

* Homenet Naming Authority: (HNA) is a function responsible for
managing the Public Homenet Zone. This includes populating the Public
Homenet Zone, signing the zone for DNSSEC, as well as managing the
distribution of that Homenet Zone to the Outsourcing Infrastructure.

* Outsourcing Infrastructure: is the infrastructure responsible for
receiving the Public Homenet Zone and publishing it on the Internet. It
is mainly composed of a Distribution Master and Public Authoritative
Servers.

* Public Authoritative Servers: are the authoritative name servers
for the Public Homenet Zone. Name resolution requests for the Homenet
Domain are sent to these servers. For resiliency the Public Homenet Zone
SHOULD be hosted on multiple servers.

* Homenet Authoritative Servers: are authoritative name servers within
the Homenet network.

* Distribution Master (DM): is the (set of) server(s) to which the HNA
synchronizes the Public Homenet Zone, and which then distributes the
relevant information to the Public Authoritative Servers.

* Homenet Reverse Zone: The reverse zone file associated with the Public
Homenet Zone.

* Reverse Public Authoritative Servers: equivalent to Public
Authoritative Servers specifically for reverse resolution.

* Reverse Distribution Master: equivalent to Distribution Master
specifically for reverse resolution.

* Homenet DNSSEC Resolver: a resolver that performs a DNSSEC resolution
on the home network for the Public Homenet Zone. The resolution is
performed requesting the Homenet Authoritative Servers.

* DNSSEC Resolver: a resolver that performs a DNSSEC resolution on the
Internet for the Public Homenet Zone. The resolution is performed
requesting the Public Authoritative Servers.


# Architecture Description  {#sec-arc-desc}

This section provides an overview of the architecture for outsourcing
the authoritative naming service from the HNA to the Outsourcing
Infrastructure in {{sec-arch-overview}}. Section {{sec-homenet-zone}}
and {{sec-configuration-parameters}} illustrates this architecture with
the example of a Public Homenet Zone as well as necessary parameter to
configure the HNA.

## Architecture Overview {#sec-arch-overview}

Figure {{fig-naming-arch}} illustrates the architecture where the HNA
outsources the publication of the Public Homenet Zone to the Outsourcing
Infrastructure.

The Public Homenet Zone is identified by the Registered Homenet Domain
Name -- example.com.

".local" as well as ".home.arpa" are explicitly not considered as Public
Homenet zones.

The HNA SHOULD build the Public Homenet Zone in a single view populated
with all resource records that are expected to be published on the
Internet.

Resource records associated with services or devices that are not
expected to be resolvable from outside the home network, or resource
records bound to non-globally reachable IP addresses e.g. ULA, MUST NOT
be part of the Public Homenet Zone.

How the Public Homenet Zone is populated is out of the scope of this
document. The node providing the HNA function may also host or interact
with multiple services to determine name-to-address mappings, such as a
web GUI, DHCP {{!RFC6644}}, mDNS {{!RFC6762}} and its evolution to {{-DNS-SD}}.
These services may coexist and may be used to populate the Public Homenet Zone.

The HNA also signs the Public Homenet Zone. The HNA handles all
operations and keying material required for DNSSEC, so there is no
provision made in this architecture for transferring private DNSSEC
related keying material between the HNA and the DM.

Once the Public Homenet Zone has been built, the HNA outsources it to
the Outsourcing Infrastructure as described in {{fig-naming-arch}}.

The HNA acts as a hidden primary while the DM behaves as a secondary
responsible to distribute the Public Homenet Zone to the multiple Public
Authoritative Servers that Outsourcing Infrastructure is responsible
for.

The DM has 3 communication channels:
  * a DM Control Channel (see section {{sec-ctrl}}) to configure the
HNA and the Outsourcing Infrastructure,
  * a DM Synchronization Channel (see section {{sec-synch}} to
synchronize the Public Homenet Zone on the HNA and on the DM.
  * one or more Distribution Channels (see section {{sec-dist}} that
distributes the Public Homenet Zone from the DM to the Public
Authoritative Server serving the Public Homenet Zone on the Internet.

There MAY be multiple DM's, and multiple servers per DM. This text
assumes a single DM server for simplicity, but there is no reason why
each channel need to be implemented on the same server, or indeed use
the same code base.

It is important to note that while the HNA is configured as an
authoritative server, it is not expected to answer to DNS requests from
the public Internet for the Public Homenet Zone.
The function of the HNA is limited to building the zone and synchronization with the DM.
The HNA is expected to be able answer queries from within the Homenet, particularly when connectivity to the Internet is unavailable.
This may need some implicit configuration to the Homenet recursive DNS servers.
{{zone-configuration}} provides some guidance on different ways to accomplish this.

The addresses associated with the HNA SHOULD NOT be mentioned in the NS
records of the Public Homenet zone, unless additional security
provisions necessary to protect the HNA from external attack have been
taken.

The Outsourcing Infrastructure is also responsible for ensuring the DS
record has been updated in the parent zone.

Resolution is performed by the DNSSEC resolvers. When the resolution is
performed outside the home network, the DNSSEC Resolver resolves the DS
record on the Global DNS and the name associated to the Public Homenet
Zone (example.com) on the Public Authoritative Servers.

When the resolution is performed from within the home network, the
Homenet DNSSEC Resolver may proceed similarly. On the other hand, to
provide resilience to the Public Homenet Zone in case of disruption, the
Homenet DNSSEC Resolver SHOULD be able to perform the resolution on the
authoritative name service of the home network implemented by the
Homenet Authoritative Servers. These servers are not expected to be
mentioned in the Public Homenet Zone, nor to be accessible from the
Internet. As such their information as well as the corresponding signed
DS record MAY be provided by the HNA to the Homenet DNSSEC Resolvers
e.g. using HNCP. Such configuration is outside the scope of this document.

How the Homenet Authoritative Servers are provisioned is also out of
scope of this specification. It could be implemented using primary
secondaries servers, or via rsync. In some cases, the HNA and Homenet
Authoritative Servers may be combined together which would result in a
common instantiation of an authoritative server on the WAN and inner
interface.  Other mechanisms may also be used.

## Distribution Master Communication Channels {#sec-comms}

This section details the interfaces and channels of the DM, that is the
Control Channel, the Synchronization Channel and the Distribution
Channel.

The Control Channel and the Synchronization Channel are the interfaces
used between the HNA and the Outsourcing Infrastructure. The entity
within the Outsourcing Infrastructure responsible to handle these
communications is the DM and communications between the HNA and the DM
SHOULD be protected and mutually authenticated. While section
{{sec-ctrl-security}} discusses in more depth the different security
protocols that could be used to secure, this specification RECOMMENDS
the use of TLS with mutually authentication based on certificates to
secure the channel between the HNA and the DM.

The Control Channel is used to set up the Synchronization Channel. We
assume that the HNA initiates the Control Channel connection with the DM
and as such has a prior knowledge of the DM identity (X509 certificate),
the IP address and port to use and protocol to set secure session.
We also assume the DM has knowledge of the identity of the HNA (X509
certificate) as well as the Registered Homenet Domain.

The information exchanged between the HNA and the DM is using DNS
messages. DNS messages can be protected using various kind of transport
layers, among others, UDP:53/DTLS, TLS/TCP:53, HTTPS:443. There was
consideration to using a standard TSIG {{!RFC2845}} or SIG(0)
{{!RFC2931}} to perform a dynamic DNS update to the DM. There are a
number of issues with this.  The main one is that the Dynamic DNS update
would also update the zone's NS records, while the goal is to update the
Distribution Master's configuration files.  The visible NS records
SHOULD remain pointing at the cloud provider's anycast addresses.
Revealing the address of the HNA in the DNS is not desireable.

This specification also assumes the same transport protocol and ports
used by the DM to serve the Control Channel and by the HNA to serve the
Synchronization Channel are the same.

The Distribution Channel is internal to the Outsourcing Infrastructure
and as such is not the primary concern of this specification.

# Control Channel between HNA and DM {#sec-ctrl}

The DM Control Channel is used by the HNA and the Outsourcing
Infrastructure to exchange information related to the configuration of
the delegation which includes:

## Information to build the Public Homenet Zone.

More specifically, the Public Homenet Zone contains information that is
related to the infrastructure serving the zone. In our case, the
infrastructure serving the Public Homenet Zone is the Outsourcing
Infrastructure, so this information MUST reflect that Outsourcing
Infrastructure and MUST be provided to the HNA.

The information includes at least names and IP addresses of the Public
Authoritative Servers. In term of RRset information this corresponds,
for the Registered Homenet Domain the MNAME of the SOA, the NS and
associated A and AAA RRsets. Optionally the Outsourcing Infrastructure
MAY also provide operational parameters such as other fields of SOA
(SERIAL, RNAME, REFRESH, RETRY, EXPIRE and MINIMUM). As the information
is necessary for the HNA to proceed and the information is associated to
the Outsourcing Infrastructure, this information exchange is mandatory.

## Information to build the DNSSEC chain of trust.

The HNA SHOULD provide the hash of the KSK (DS RRset), so the that
Outsourcing Infrastructure provides this value to the parent zone.  A
common deployment use case is that the Outsourcing Infrastructure is the
registrar of the Registered Homenet Domain, and as such, its
relationship with the registry of the parent zone enables it to update
the parent zone. When such relation exists, the HNA should be able to
request the Outsourcing Infrastructure to update the DS RRset in the
parent zone. A direct update is especially necessary to initialize the
chain of trust.

Though the HNA may also later directly update the values of the DS via
the Control Channel, it is RECOMMENDED to use other mechanisms such as
CDS and CDNSKEY {{!RFC7344}} are used for key roll overs.

As some deployment may not provide an Outsourcing Infrastructure that
will be able to update the DS in the parent zone, this information
exchange is OPTIONAL.

By accepting the DS, the DM commits in taking care of advertising
the DS to the parent zone. Upon refusal, the DM MUST clearly indicate
the DM does not have the capacity to proceed to the update.

## Information to set the Synchronization Channel,

That information sets the  primary/secondary relation between the HNA
and the DM. The HNA works as a primary authoritative DNS server, and
MUST provide the corresponding IP address.

The specified IP address on the HNA side and the currently used IP
address of the DM defines the IP addresses involved in the
Synchronization Channel. Ports and transport protocol are the same as
those used by the Control Channel. By default, the same IP address used
by the HNA is considered by the DM. Exchange of this information is
OPTIONAL.

## Deleting the delegation

The purpose of the previous sections were to exchange information in
order to set a delegation. The HNA MUST also be able to delete a
delegation with a specific DM. Upon an instruction of deleting the
delegation, the DM MUST stop serving the Public Homenet Zone.

## Messages Exchange Description {#sec-ctrl-messages}

There are multiple ways these information could be exchanged between the
HNA and the DM. This specification defines a mechanism that re-use the
DNS exchanges format. The intention is to reuse standard libraries
especially to check the format of the exchanged fields as well as to
minimize the additional libraries needed for the HNA. The re-use of DNS
exchanges achieves these goals. Note that while information is provided
using DNS exchanges, the exchanged information is not expected to be set
in any zone file, instead this information is expected to be processed
appropriately.

The Control Channel is not expected to be a long term session. After a
predefined timer the Control Channel is expected to be terminated. The
Control Channel MAY Be re-opened at any time later.

The provisioning process SHOULD provide a method of securing the control
channel, so that the content of messages can be authenticated. This
authentication MAY be based on certificates for both the DM and each
HNA. The DM may also create the initial configuration for the delegation
zone in the parent zone during the provisioning process.

### Retrieving information for the Public Homenet Zone.

The information provided by the DM to the HNA is retrieved by the HNA
with a AXFR exchange. The AXFR message enables the response to contain
any type of RRsets. The response might be extended in the future if
additional information will be needed. Alternatively, the information
provided by the HNA to the DM is pushed by the HNA via a DNS update
exchange.

To retrieve the necessary information to build the Public Homenet Zone,
the HNA MUST send an DNS request of type AXFR associated to the
Registered Homenet Domain. The DM MUST respond with a zone template. The
zone template MUST contain a RRset of type SOA, one or multiple RRset of
type NS and at least one RRset of type A or AAAA. The SOA RR is used to
indicate to the HNA the value of the MNAME of the Public Homenet Zone.
The NAME of the SOA RR MUST be the Registered Homenet Domain. The MNAME
value of the SOA RDATA is the value provided by the Outsourcing
Infrastructure to the HNA. Other RDATA values (RNAME, REFRESH, RETRY,
EXPIRE and MINIMUM) are provided by the Outsourcing Infrastructure as
suggestions. The NS RRsets are used to carry the Public Authoritative
Servers of the Outsourcing Infrastructure. Their associated NAME MUST be
the Registered Homenet Domain. The TTL and RDATA are those expected to
be published on the Public Homenet Zone. The RRsets of Type A and AAAA
MUST have their NAME matching the NSDNAME of one of the NS RRsets.

Upon receiving the response, the HNA MUST validate the conditions on the
SOA, NS and A or AAAA RRsets. If an error occurs, the HNA MUST stop
proceeding and MUST report an error. Otherwise, the HNA builds the
Public Homenet Zone by setting the MNAME value of the SOA as indicated
by the SOA provided by the AXFR response. The HNA SHOULD set the value
of NAME, REFRESH, RETRY, EXPIRE and MINIMUM of the SOA to those provided
by the AXFR response. The HNA MUST insert the NS and corresponding A or
AAAA RRset in its Public Homenet Zone. The HNA MUST ignore other RRsets.
If an error message is returned by the DM, the HNA MUST proceed as a
regular DNS resolution. Error messages SHOULD be logged for further
analysis. If the resolution does not succeed, the outsourcing operation
is aborted and the HNA MUST close the Control Channel.

### Providing information for the DNSSEC chain of trust

To provide the DS RRset to initialize the DNSSEC chain of trust the HNA
MAY send a DNS UPDATE {{!RFC2136}} message. The NAME in the SOA MUST be
set to the parent zone of the Registered Homenet Domain - that is where
the DS records should be inserted. The DS RRset MUST be placed in the
Update section of the UPDATE query, and the NAME SHOULD be set to the
Registered Homenet Domain. The rdata of the DS RR SHOULD correspond to
the DS record to be inserted in the parent zone.

A NOERROR response from the MD is a commitment to update the parent zone
with the provided DS. An error indicates the MD will not update the DS,
and other method should be used by the HNA.

### Providing information for the Synchronization Channel

To provide the IP address of the primary, the HNA MAY send a DNS UPDATE
message. The NAME in the SOA MUST be the parent zone of the Registered
Homenet Domain. The Update section MUST be a RRset of Type NS. The NAME
associated to the NS RRSet MUST be the Registered Domain Name. The RDATA
MUST be a FQDN that designates the IP addresses associated to the
primary. There may be multiple IP addresses. These IP addresses MUST be
provided in the additional section. The reason to provide these IP
addresses is that it is NOT RECOMMENDED to publish these IP addresses.
As a result, it is not expected to resolve them. IP addresses are
provided via RRsets of type A or AAAA. The NAME associated to RRsets of
type A and AAAA MUST be the Registered Homenet Domain.

A NOERROR response indicates the DM has configured the secondary and is
committed to serve as a secondary. An error indicates the DM is not
configured as a secondary.

The regular DNS error message SHOULD be returned to the HNA when an
error occurs. In particular a FORMERR is returned when a format error is
found, this error includes when unexpected RRSets are added or when
RRsets are missing. A SERVFAIL error is returned when a internal error
is encountered. a NOTZONE error is returned when update and Zone
sections are not coherent, a NOTAUTH error is returned when the DM is
not authoritative for the Zone section. A REFUSED error is returned when
the DM refuses to proceed to the configuration and the requested action.

### HNA instructing deleting the delegation

To instruct to delete the delegation the HNA MAY  send a DNS UPDATE
Delete message. The NAME in the SOA MUST be the parent zone of the
Registered Homenet Domain. The Update section MUST be a RRset of Type
NS. The NAME associated to the NS RRSet MUST be the Registered Domain
Name. As indictaed by {{!RFC2136}} section 2.5.2 the delete instruction
is set by setting the TTL to 0, the CLass to ANY, the RDLENGTH to 0 and
the RDATA MUST be empty.


## Securing the Control Channel between HNA and DM {#sec-ctrl-security}

The control channel between the HNA and the DM MUST be secured at both
the HNA and the DM.

Secure protocols (like TLS {{!RFC5246}} / DTLS {{!RFC6347}}) SHOULD be
used to secure the transactions between the DM and the HNA.

The advantage of TLS/DTLS is that this technology is widely deployed,
and most of the devices already embed TLS/DTLS libraries, possibly also
taking advantage of hardware acceleration. Further, TLS/DTLS provides
authentication facilities and can use certificates to authenticate the
DM and the HNA. On the other hand, using TLS/DTLS
requires implementing DNS exchanges over TLS/DTLS, as well as a new
service port.  This document RECOMMENDS this option.

The HNA SHOULD authenticate inbound connections from the DM using
standard mechanisms, such as a public certificate with baked-in root
certificates on the HNA, or via DANE {!RFC6698}}.

The DM SHOULD authenticate the HNA and check that inbound messages are
from the appropriate client.  The DM MAY use a self-signed CA
certificate mechanism per HNA, or public certificates for this purpose.

IPsec {{!RFC4301}} IKEv2 {{!RFC7296}} MAY also be used to secure
transactions between the HNA and the DM. Similarly to TLS/DTLS, most
HNAs already embed an IPsec stack, and IKEv2 supports multiple
authentication mechanisms via the EAP framework. In addition, IPsec can
be used to protect DNS exchanges between the HNA and the DM without any
modifications of the DNS server or client. DNS integration over IPsec
only requires an additional security policy in the Security Policy
Database (SPD). One disadvantage of IPsec is that NATs and firewall
traversal may be problematic. However, in our case, the HNA is connected
to the Internet, and IPsec communication between the HNA and the DM
should not be impacted by middle boxes.

How the PSK can be used by any of the TSIG, TLS/DTLS or IPsec protocols:
Authentication based on certificates implies a mutual authentication and
thus requires the HNA to manage a private key, a public key, or
certificates, as well as Certificate Authorities. This adds complexity
to the configuration especially on the HNA side. For this reason, we
RECOMMEND that the HNA MAY use PSK or certificate based authentication,
and that the DM MUST support PSK and certificate based authentication.

Note also that authentication of message exchanges between the HNA and
the DM SHOULD NOT use the external IP address of the HNA to index the
appropriate keys. As detailed in {{sec-renumbering}}, the IP addresses
of the DM and the Hidden Primary are subject to change, for example
while the network is being renumbered. This means that the necessary
keys to authenticate transaction SHOULD NOT be indexed using the IP
address, and SHOULD be resilient to IP address changes.

## Implementation Tips {#sec-ctrl-implementation}

The Hidden Primary Server on the HNA differs from a regular
authoritative server for the home network due to:

* Interface Binding: the Hidden Primary Server will almost certainly
listen on the WAN Interface, whereas a regular authoritative server for
the home network would listen on the internal home network interface.

* Limited exchanges: the purpose of the Hidden Primary Server is to
synchronize with the DM, not to serve any zones to end users, or the
public Internet.

As a result, exchanges are performed with specific nodes (the DM).
Further, exchange types are limited. The only legitimate exchanges are:
NOTIFY initiated by the Hidden Primary and IXFR or AXFR exchanges
initiated by the DM. On the other hand, regular authoritative servers
would respond to any hosts, and any DNS query would be processed. The
HNA SHOULD filter IXFR/AXFR traffic and drop traffic not initiated by
the DM.  The HNA MUST listen for DNS on TCP and UDP and MUST at least
allow SOA lookups of the Homenet Zone.


# DM Synchronization Channel between HNA and DM {#sec-synch}

The DM Synchronization Channel is used for communication between the HNA
and the DM for synchronizing the Public Homenet Zone.  Note that the
Control Channel and the Synchronization Channel are by construction
different channels even though there they MAY use the same IP addresses.
In fact the Control Channel is set between the HNA working as a client
using port YYYY (a high range port) toward a service provided by the MD
at port XX (well known port). On the other hand, the Synchronization
Channel is set between the MD working as a client using port ZZZZ ( a
high range port) toward a service a service provided  by the HNA at port
XX. As a result, even though the same couple of IP addresses may be
involved the Control Channel and the Synchronization Channel are always
disc tint channels.

Uploading and dynamically updating the zone file on the DM can be seen
as zone provisioning between the HNA (Hidden Primary) and the DM
(Secondary Server). This can be handled via AXFR + DNS UPDATE.

This document RECOMMENDS use of a primary / secondary mechanism instead
of the use of DNS UPDATE. The primary / secondary mechanism is
RECOMMENDED as it scales better and avoids DoS attacks. Note that even
when UPDATE messages are used, these messages are using a distinct
channel as those used to set the configuration.

Note that there is no standard way to distribute a DNS primary between
multiple devices. As a result, if multiple devices are candidate for
hosting the Hidden Primary, some specific mechanisms should be designed
so the home network only selects a single HNA for the Hidden Primary.
Selection mechanisms based on HNCP {{!RFC7788}} are good candidates.

The HNA acts as a Hidden Primary Server, which is a regular
authoritative DNS Server listening on the WAN interface.

The DM is configured as a secondary for the Homenet Domain Name. This
secondary configuration has been previously agreed between the end user
and the provider of the Outsourcing Infrastructure as part of either the
provisioning or due to receipt of UPDATE messages on the DM Control
Channel.

The Homenet Reverse Zone MAY also be updated either with DNS UPDATE
{{!RFC2136}} or using a primary / secondary synchronization.

## Securing the Synchronization Channel between HNA and DM {#sec-synch-security}

The Synchronization Channel used standard DNS request.

First the primary notifies the secondary that the zone must be updated
and eaves the secondary to proceed with the update when possible/
convenient.

Then, a NOTIFY message is sent by the primary, which is a small packet
that is less likely to load the secondary.

Finally, the AXFR {{!RFC1034}} or IXFR {{!RFC1995}} query performed by
the secondary is a small packet sent over TCP (section 4.2
{{!RFC5936}}), which mitigates reflection attacks using a forged NOTIFY.

The AXFR request from the DM to the HNA SHOULD be secured.  DNS over TLS
{{!RFC7858}} is RECOMMENDED.

When using TLS, the HNA MAY authenticate inbound connections from the DM
using standard mechanisms, such as a public certificate with baked-in
root certificates on the HNA, or via DANE {!RFC6698}}

The HNA MAY apply a simple IP filter on inbound AXFR requests to ensure
they only arrive from the DM Synchronization Channel. In this case, the
HNA SHOULD regularly check (via DNS resolution) that the address of the
DM in the filter is still valid.

# DM Distribution Channel {#sec-dist}

The DM Distribution Channel is used for communication between the DM and
the Public Authoritative Servers. The architecture and communication
used for the DM Distribution Channels is outside the scope of this
document, and there are many existing solutions available e.g. rsynch,
DNS AXFR, REST, DB copy.

# HNA Security Policies {#sec-cpe-sec-policies}

This section details security policies related to the Hidden Primary /
Secondary synchronization.

The Hidden Primary, as described in this document SHOULD drop any
queries from the home network. This could be implemented via port
binding and/or firewall rules. The precise mechanism deployed is out of
scope of this document.  The Hidden Primary SHOULD drop any DNS queries
arriving on the WAN interface that are not issued from the DM.  The
Hidden Primary SHOULD drop any outgoing packets other than DNS NOTIFY
query, SOA response, IXFR response or AXFR responses.  The Hidden
Primary SHOULD drop any incoming packets other than DNS NOTIFY response,
SOA query, IXFR query or AXFR query.  The Hidden Primary SHOULD drop any
non protected IXFR or AXFR exchange,depending on how the synchronization
is secured.


# DNSSEC compliant Homenet Architecture {#sec-dnssec-deplyment}

{{!RFC7368}} in Section 3.7.3 recommends DNSSEC to be deployed on both
the authoritative server and the resolver. The resolver side is out of
scope of this document, and only the authoritative part of the server is
considered.

This document assumes the HNA signs the Public Homenet Zone.

Secure delegation is achieved only if the DS RRset is properly set in
the parent zone. Secure delegation is performed by the HNA or the
Outsourcing Infrastructures.

The DS RRset can be updated manually with nsupdate for example. This
requires the HNA or the Outsourcing Infrastructure to be authenticated
by the DNS server hosting the parent of the Public Homenet Zone. Such a
trust channel between the HNA and the parent DNS server may be hard to
maintain with HNAs, and thus may be easier to establish with the
Outsourcing Infrastructure. In fact, the Public Authoritative Server(s)
may use Automating DNSSEC Delegation Trust Maintenance  {{!RFC7344}}.


# Homenet Reverse Zone {#sec-reverse}

This section is focused on the Homenet Reverse Zone.

Firstly, all considerations for the Public Homenet Zone apply to the
Homenet Reverse Zone. The main difference between the Homenet Reverse
Zone and the Homenet Zone is that the parent zone of the Homenet Reverse
Zone is most likely managed by the ISP. As the ISP also provides the IP
prefix to the HNA, it may be able to authenticate the HNA using
mechanisms outside the scope of this document e.g. the physical
attachment point to the ISP network. If the Reverse DM is managed by the
ISP, credentials to authenticate the HNA for the zone synchronization
may be set automatically and transparently to the end user.
{{?I-D.ietf-homenet-naming-architecture-dhc-options}} describes how
automatic configuration may be performed.

With IPv6, the domain space for IP addresses is so large that reverse
zone may be confronted with scalability issues. How the reverse zone is
generated is out of scope of this document.
{{?I-D.howard-dnsop-ip6rdns}} provides guidance on how to address
scalability issues.


# Renumbering {#sec-renumbering}


This section details how renumbering is handled by the Hidden Primary
server or the DM. Both types of renumbering are
discussed i.e. "make-before-break" and "break-before-make".

In the make-before-break renumbering scenario, the new prefix is
advertised, the network is configured to prepare the transition to the
new prefix. During a period of time, the two prefixes old and new
coexist, before the old prefix is completely removed. In the
break-before-make renumbering scenario, the new prefix is advertised
making the old prefix obsolete.

Renumbering has been extensively described in {{!RFC4192}} and analyzed
in {{!RFC7010}} and the reader is expected to be familiar with them
before reading this section.

## Hidden Primary {#sec-primary}

In a renumbering scenario, the Hidden Primary is informed it is being
renumbered. In most cases, this occurs because the whole home network is
being renumbered. As a result, the Public Homenet Zone will also be
updated.  Although the new and old IP addresses may be stored in the
Public Homenet Zone, we recommend that only the newly reachable IP
addresses be published.

To avoid reachability disruption, IP connectivity information provided
by the DNS SHOULD be coherent with the IP plane. In our case, this means
the old IP address SHOULD NOT be provided via the DNS when it is not
reachable anymore. Let for example TTL be the TTL associated with a
RRset of the Public Homenet Zone, it may be cached for TTL seconds. Let
T_NEW be the time the new IP address replaces the old IP address in the
Homenet Zone, and T_OLD_UNREACHABLE the time the old IP is not reachable
anymore.

In the case of the make-before-break, seamless reachability is provided
as long as T_OLD_UNREACHABLE - T_NEW > 2 * TTL. If this is not
satisfied, then devices associated with the old IP address in the home
network may become unreachable for 2 * TTL - (T_OLD_UNREACHABLE -
T_NEW). In the case of a break-before-make, T_OLD_UNREACHABLE = T_NEW,
and the device may become unreachable up to 2 * TTL.

Once the Public Homenet Zone file has been updated on the Hidden
Primary, the Hidden Primary needs to inform the Outsourcing
Infrastructure that the Public Homenet Zone has been updated and that
the IP address to use to retrieve the updated zone has also been
updated. Both notifications are performed using regular DNS exchanges.
Mechanisms to update an IP address provided by lower layers with
protocols like SCTP {{!RFC4960}}, MOBIKE {{!RFC4555}} are not considered
in this document.

The Hidden Primary SHOULD inform the DM that the Public Homenet Zone has
been updated by sending a NOTIFY payload with the new IP address. In
addition, this NOTIFY payload SHOULD be authenticated using SIG(0) or
TSIG. When the DM receives the NOTIFY payload, it
MUST authenticate it. Note that the cryptographic key used for the
authentication SHOULD be indexed by the Registered Homenet Domain
contained in the NOTIFY payload as well as the RRSIG. In other words,
the IP address SHOULD NOT be used as an index. If authentication
succeeds, the DM MUST also notice the IP address has been modified and
perform a reachability check before updating its primary configuration.
The routability check MAY performed by sending a SOA request to the
Hidden Primary using the source IP address of the NOTIFY. This exchange
is also secured, and if an authenticated response is received from the
Hidden Primary with the new IP address, the DM SHOULD update its
configuration file and retrieve the Public Homenet Zone using an AXFR or
a IXFR exchange.

Note that the primary reason for providing the IP address is that the
Hidden Primary is not publicly announced in the DNS. If the Hidden
Primary were publicly announced in the DNS, then the IP address update
could have been performed using the DNS as described in
{{sec-secondary}}.


## Distribution Master {#sec-secondary}

Renumbering of the Distribution Master results in it changing its IP
address.   As the DM is a secondary, the destination of DNS NOTIFY
payloads MUST be changed, and any configuration/firewalling that
restricts DNS AXFR/IXFR operations MUST be updated.

If the DM is configured in the Hidden Primary configuration file using a
FQDN, then the update of the IP address is performed by DNS.  More
specifically, before sending the NOTIFY, the Hidden Primary performs a
DNS resolution to retrieve the IP address of the secondary.

As described in {{sec-primary}}, the DM DNS information SHOULD be
coherent with the IP plane.  The TTL of the Distribution Master name
SHOULD be adjusted appropriately prior to changing the IP address.

Some DNS infrastructure uses the IP address to designate the secondary,
in which case, other mechanisms must be found. The reason for using IP
addresses instead of names is generally to reach an internal interface
that is not designated by a FQDN, and to avoid potential bootstrap
problems. Such scenarios are considered as out of scope in the case of
home networks.

# Operational considerations for Offline/Disconnected resolution

This section is non-normative.
It provides suggestions on operational consideration.  TBD.

# Privacy Considerations {#sec-privacy}

Outsourcing the DNS Authoritative service from the HNA to a third party
raises a few privacy related concerns.

The Public Homenet Zone contains a full description of the services
hosted in the network. These services may not be expected to be publicly
shared although their names remain accessible through the Internet. Even
though DNS makes information public, the DNS does not expect to make the
complete list of services public. In fact, making information public
still requires the key (or FQDN) of each service to be known by the
resolver in order to retrieve information about the services. More
specifically, making mywebsite.example.com public in the DNS, is not
sufficient to make resolvers aware of the existence web site. However,
an attacker may walk the reverse DNS zone, or use other reconnaissance
techniques to learn this information as described in {{!RFC7707}}.

In order to prevent the complete Public Homenet Zone being published on
the Internet, AXFR queries SHOULD be blocked on the Public Authoritative
Server(s). Similarly, to avoid zone-walking NSEC3 {{!RFC5155}} SHOULD be
preferred over NSEC {{!RFC4034}}.  When the Public Homenet Zone is
outsourced, the end user should be aware that it provides a complete
description of the services available on the home network. More
specifically, names usually provides a clear indication of the service
and possibly even the device type, and as the Public Homenet Zone
contains the IP addresses associated with the service, they also limit
the scope of the scan space.

In addition to the Public Homenet Zone, the third party can also monitor
the traffic associated with the Public Homenet Zone. This traffic may
provide an indication of the services an end user accesses, plus how and
when they use these services. Although, caching may obfuscate this
information inside the home network, it is likely that outside your home
network this information will not be cached.

# Security Considerations {#sec-security}

The Homenet Naming Architecture described in this document solves
exposing the HNA's DNS service as a DoS attack vector.

## HNA DM channels
The HNA DM channels are specified to include their own security mechanisms
that are designed to provide the minimum attacke surface, and to authenticate
transactions where necessary.

## Names are less secure than IP addresses {#sec-name-less-secure}

This document describes how an end user can make their services and
devices from his home network reachable on the Internet by using names
rather than IP addresses. This exposes the home network to attackers,
since names are expected to include less entropy than IP addresses.  In
fact, with IP addresses, the Interface Identifier is 64 bits long
leading to up to 2^64 possibilities for a given subnetwork. This is not
to mention that the subnet prefix is also of 64 bits long, thus
providing up to 2^64 possibilities. On the other hand, names used either
for the home network domain or for the devices present less entropy
(livebox, router, printer, nicolas, jennifer, ...) and thus potentially
exposes the devices to dictionary attacks.


## Names are less volatile than IP addresses {#sec-name-less-volatile}

IP addresses may be used to locate a device, a host or a service.
However, home networks are not expected to be assigned a time invariant
prefix by ISPs. As a result, observing IP addresses only provides some
ephemeral information about who is accessing the service. On the other
hand, names are not expected to be as volatile as IP addresses. As a
result, logging names over time may be more valuable than logging IP
addresses, especially to profile an end user's characteristics.

PTR provides a way to bind an IP address to a name. In that sense,
responding to PTR DNS queries may affect the end user's privacy. For
that reason end users may choose not to respond to PTR DNS queries and
MAY instead return a NXDOMAIN response.


## DNS Reflection Attacks {#sec-reflection-attack}

An attacker performs a reflection attack when it sends traffic to one or
more intermediary nodes (reflectors), that in turn send back response
traffic to the victim. Motivations for using an intermediary node might
be anonymity of the attacker, as well as amplification of the traffic.
Typically, when the intermediary node is a DNSSEC server, the attacker
sends a DNSSEC query and the victim is likely to receive a DNSSEC
response. This section analyzes how the different components may be
involved as a reflector in a reflection attack.
{{sec-reflection-hidden-primary}} considers the Hidden Primary,
{{sec-reflection-public-auth-name-server-set}} the Synchronization
Server, and {{sec-reflection-public-primary}} the Public Authoritative
Server(s).

## Reflection Attack involving the Hidden Primary {#sec-reflection-hidden-primary}

With the specified architecture, the Hidden Primary is only expected to
receive DNS queries of type SOA, AXFR or IXFR. This section analyzes how
these DNS queries may be used by an attacker to perform a reflection
attack.

DNS queries of type AXFR and IXFR use TCP and as such are less subject
to reflection attacks. This makes SOA queries the only remaining
practical vector of attacks for reflection attacks, based on UDP.

SOA queries are not associated with a large amplification factor
compared to queries of type "ANY" or to query of non existing FQDNs.
This reduces the probability a DNS query of type SOA will be involved in
a DDoS attack.

SOA queries are expected to follow a very specific pattern, which makes
rate limiting techniques an efficient way to limit such attacks, and
associated impact on the naming service of the home network.

Motivations for such a flood might be a reflection attack, but could
also be a resource exhaustion attack performed against the Hidden
Primary.  The Hidden Primary only expects to exchange traffic with the
DM, that is its associated secondary. Even though
secondary servers may be renumbered as mentioned in {{sec-renumbering}},
the Hidden Primary is likely to perform a DNSSEC resolution and find out
the associated secondary's IP addresses in use. As a result, the Hidden
Primary is likely to limit the origin of its incoming traffic based on
the origin IP address.

With filtering rules based on IP address, SOA flooding attacks are
limited to forged packets with the IP address of the secondary server.
In other words, the only victims are the Hidden Primary itself or the
secondary. There is a need for the Hidden Primary to limit that flood to
limit the impact of the reflection attack on the secondary, and to limit
the resource needed to carry on the traffic by the HNA hosting the
Hidden Primary. On the other hand, mitigation should be performed
appropriately, so as to limit the impact on the legitimate SOA sent by
the secondary.

The main reason for the DM sending a SOA query is to
update the SOA RRset after the TTL expires, to check the serial number
upon the receipt of a NOTIFY query from the Hidden Primary, or to
re-send the SOA request when the response has not been received.  When a
flood of SOA queries is received by the Hidden Primary, the Hidden
Primary may assume it is involved in an attack.

There are few legitimate time slots when the secondary is expected to
send a SOA query. Suppose T_NOTIFY is the time a NOTIFY is sent by the
Hidden Primary, T_SOA the last time the SOA has been queried, TTL the
TTL associated to the SOA, and T_REFRESH the refresh time defined in the
SOA RRset. The specific time SOA queries are expected can be for example
T_NOTIFY, T_SOA + 2/3 TTL, T_SOA + TTL, T_SOA + T_REFRESH., and. Outside
a few minutes following these specific time slots, the probability that
the HNA discards a legitimate SOA query is very low. Within these time
slots, the probability the secondary may have its legitimate query
rejected is higher. If a legitimate SOA is discarded, the secondary will
re-send SOA query every "retry time" second until "expire time" seconds
occurs, where "retry time" and "expire time" have been defined in the
SOA.

As a result, it is RECOMMENDED to set rate limiting policies to protect
HNA resources. If a flood lasts more than the expired time defined by
the SOA, it is RECOMMENDED to re-initiate a synchronization between the
Hidden Primary and the secondaries.



## Reflection Attacks involving the DM {#sec-reflection-public-auth-name-server-set}

The DM acts as a secondary coupled with  the Hidden
Primary. The secondary expects to receive NOTIFY query, SOA responses,
AXFR and IXFR responses from the Hidden Primary.

Sending a NOTIFY query to the secondary generates a NOTIFY response as
well as initiating an SOA query exchange from the secondary to the
Hidden Primary. As mentioned in {{!RFC1996}}, this is a known "benign
denial of service attack".  As a result, the DM
SHOULD enforce rate limiting on sending SOA queries and NOTIFY responses
to the Hidden Primary. Most likely, when the secondary is flooded with
valid and signed NOTIFY queries, it is under a replay attack which is
discussed in {{sec-replay-attack}}. The key thing here is that the
secondary is likely to be designed to be able to process much more
traffic than the Hidden Primary hosted on a HNA.

This paragraph details how the secondary may limit the NOTIFY queries.
Because the Hidden Primary may be renumbered, the secondary SHOULD NOT
perform permanent IP filtering based on IP addresses. In addition, a
given secondary may be shared among multiple Hidden Primaries which make
filtering rules based on IP harder to set. The time at which a NOTIFY is
sent by the Hidden Primary is not predictable.  However, a flood of
NOTIFY messages may be easily detected, as a NOTIFY originated from a
given Homenet Zone is expected to have a very limited number of unique
source IP addresses, even when renumbering is occurring. As a result,
the secondary, MAY rate limit incoming NOTIFY queries.

On the Hidden Primary side, it is recommended that the Hidden Primary
sends a NOTIFY as long as the zone has not been updated by the
secondary. Multiple SOA queries may indicate the secondary is under
attack.

## Reflection Attacks involving the Public Authoritative Servers {#sec-reflection-public-primary}

Reflection attacks involving the Public Authoritative Server(s) are
similar to attacks on any Outsourcing Infrastructure. This is not
specific to the architecture described in this document, and thus are
considered as out of scope.

In fact, one motivation of the architecture described in this document
is to expose the Public Authoritative Server(s) to attacks instead of
the HNA, as it is believed that the Public Authoritative Server(s) will
be better able to defend itself.

## Flooding Attack {#sec-flooding-attack}

The purpose of flooding attacks is mostly resource exhaustion, where the
resource can be bandwidth, memory, or CPU for example.

One goal of the architecture described in this document is to
limit the surface of attack on the HNA. This is done by outsourcing the
DNS service to the Public Authoritative Server(s). By doing so, the HNA
limits its DNS interactions between the Hidden Primary and the
DM. This limits the number of entities the HNA
interacts with as well as the scope of DNS exchanges - NOTIFY, SOA,
AXFR, IXFR.

The use of an authenticated channel with SIG(0) or TSIG between the HNA
and the DM, enables detection of illegitimate DNS
queries, so appropriate action may be taken - like dropping the queries.
If signatures are validated, then most likely, the HNA is under a replay
attack, as detailed in {{sec-replay-attack}}

In order to limit the resource required for authentication, it is
recommended to use TSIG that uses symmetric cryptography over SIG(0)
that uses asymmetric cryptography.



## Replay Attack {#sec-replay-attack}

Replay attacks consist of an attacker either resending or delaying a
legitimate message that has been sent by an authorized user or process.
As the Hidden Primary and the DM use an
authenticated channel, replay attacks are mostly expected to use forged
DNS queries in order to provide valid traffic.

From the perspective of  an attacker, using a correctly authenticated
DNS query may not be detected as an attack and thus may generate a
response. Generating and sending a response consumes more resources than
either dropping the query by the defender, or generating the query by
the attacker, and thus could be used for resource exhaustion attacks. In
addition, as the authentication is performed at the DNS layer, the
source IP address could be impersonated in order to perform a reflection
attack.

{{sec-reflection-attack}} details how to mitigate reflection attacks and
{{sec-flooding-attack}} details how to mitigate resource exhaustion.
Both sections assume a context of DoS with a flood of DNS queries. This
section suggests a way to limit the attack surface of replay attacks.

As SIG(0) and TSIG use inception and expiration time, the time frame for
replay attack is limited. SIG(0) and TSIG recommends a fudge value of 5
minutes. This value has been set as a compromise between possibly loose
time synchronization between devices and the valid lifetime of the
message. As a result, better time synchronization policies could reduce
the time window of the attack.

access. For example some servers may perform PTR DNS queries to grant

it is  RECOMMENDED to deploy DNSSEC on HNAs.

# Configuration of Homenet Recursive Servers {#zone-configuration}

This is a non-normative section that describes ways to configure recursive resolver(s) so that name service is available in the Homenet even when Internet connectivity is unavailable.

# Annex

## Envisioned deployment scenarios

A number of deployment have been envisionned, this section aims at
providing a brief description. The use cases are not limitatives and
this section is not normative.

### CPE Vendor

A specific vendor with specific relations with a registrar or a registry
may sell a CPE that is provisioned with provisioned domain name. Such
domain name does not need to be necessary human readable.

One possible way is that the vendor also provisions the HNA with a
private and public keys as well as a certificate. Note that these keys
are not expected to be used for DNSSEC signing. Instead these keys are
solely used by the HNA to proceed to the authentication. Normally the
keys should be necessary and sufficient to proceed to the
authentication. The reason to combine the domain name and the key is
that outsourcing infrastructure are likely handle names better than
keys and that domain names might be used as a login which enables the
key to be regenerated.

When the home network owner plugs the CPE at home, the relation between
HNA and DM is expected to work out-of-the-box.

### Agnostic CPE

An CPE that is not preconfigured may also take advanatge to the protocol
defined in this document but some configuration steps will be needed.

1. The owner of the home network buys a domain name to a registrar, and
as such creates an account on that registrar

2. Either the registrar is also providing the outsourcing infrastructure
or the home network needs to create a specific account on the
outsourcing infrastructure.
  * If the outsourcing provider is the registrar, the outsourcing has by
design a proof of ownership of the domain name by the homenet owner. In
this case, it is expected the infrastructure provides the necessary
parameters to the home  network owner to configure the HNA. A good way
to provide the parameters would be the home network be able to
copy/paste a JSON object. What matters at that point is the outsourcing
infrastructure being able to generate authentication credentials for the
HNA to authenticate itself to the outsourcing infrastructure. This
obviously requires the home network to provide the public key gnerated
by the HNA in a CSR.

  * If the outsourcing infrastructure is
not the registrar, then the proof of ownership needs to be established
using protocols like ACME for example that will end in the generation of
a certificate. ACME is used here to the purpose of automating the
generation of the certificate, the CA may be a specific CA or the
outsourcing infrastructure. With that being done, the outsourcing
infrastructure has a roof of ownership and can proceed as above.


## Example: Homenet Zone {#sec-homenet-zone}

This section is not normative and intends to illustrate how the HNA
builds the Homenet Zone.

As depicted in {{fig-naming-arch}}, the Public
Homenet Zone is hosted on the Public Authoritative Server(s), whereas
the Homenet Zone is hosted on the HNA. This section
considers that the HNA builds the zone that will be effectively
published on the Public Authoritative Server(s). In other words "Homenet
to Public Zone transformation" is the identity also commonly designated
as "no operation" (NOP).

In that case, the Homenet Zone should configure its Name Server RRset
(NS) and Start of Authority (SOA) with the values associated with the
Public Authoritative Server(s). This is illustrated in
{{fig-homenet-zone}}. public.primary.example.net is the FQDN of the
Public Authoritative Server(s), and IP1, IP2, IP3, IP4 are the
associated IP addresses. Then the HNA should add the additional new
nodes that enter the home network, remove those that should be removed,
and sign the Homenet Zone.

{: #fig-homenet-zone title="Homenet Zone" }

The SOA RRset is defined in {{!RFC1033}}, {{!RFC1035}} and {{!RFC2308}}.
This SOA is specific, as it is used for the synchronization between the
Hidden Primary and the DM and published on the DNS
Public Authoritative Server(s)..

* MNAME: indicates the primary. In our case the zone is published on the
Public Authoritative Server(s), and its name MUST be included. If
multiple Public Authoritative Server(s) are involved, one of them MUST
be chosen. More specifically, the HNA MUST NOT include the name of the
Hidden Primary.

* RNAME: indicates the email address to reach the administrator.
{{!RFC2142}} recommends using hostmaster@domain and replacing the '@'
sign by '.'.

* REFRESH and RETRY: indicate respectively in seconds how often
secondaries need to check the primary, and the time between two refresh
when a refresh has failed.  Default values indicated by {{!RFC1033}} are
3600 (1 hour) for refresh and  600 (10 minutes) for retry. This value
might be too long for highly dynamic content. However, the Public
Authoritative Server(s) and the HNA are expected to implement NOTIFY
{{!RFC1996}}. So whilst shorter refresh timers might increase the
bandwidth usage for secondaries hosting large number of zones, it will
have little practical impact on the elapsed time required to achieve
synchronization between the Outsourcing Infrastructure and the Hidden
Master. As a result, the default values are acceptable.

* EXPIRE: is the upper limit data SHOULD be kept in absence of refresh.
The default value indicated by {{!RFC1033}} is 3600000 (approx. 42
days). In home network architectures, the HNA provides both the DNS
synchronization and the access to the home network. This device may be
plugged and unplugged by the end user without notification, thus we
recommend a long expiry timer.

* MINIMUM: indicates the minimum TTL. The default value indicated by
{{!RFC1033}} is 86400 (1 day). For home network, this value MAY be
reduced, and 3600 (1 hour) seems more appropriate.


[](<!-- ## Considerations on multiple Registered Homenet Domain Names
## are left for future versions
When multiple Registered Homenet Domains are used
-like example.com, example.net, example.org, a DNS Homenet
Zone file per Registered Homenet Domain SHOULD be generated.
In order to synchronize the zone contents, the HNA may provide
all bindings in each zone files. As a result, any update MUST
be performed on all zone files, i.e. for all Registered Homenet
Domains. To limit thees updates when multiple Registered Homenet
Domains are involved, the HNA MAY fill all bindings
in a specific zone file and redirect all other zones to that zone.
This can be achieved with redirecting mechanisms like
CNAME {{!RFC2181}}, {{!RFC1034}},
DNAME {{!RFC6672}} or CNAME+DNAME
{{?I-D.sury-dnsext-cname-dname}}. This is an
implementation issue to determine whether redirection mechanisms MAY be
preferred for large Homenet Zones, or when the number
of Registered Homenet Domain becomes quite large.

## Example: HNA necessary parameters for outsourcing {#sec-configuration-parameters}

This section specifies the various parameters required by the HNA to
configure the naming architecture of this document. This section is
informational, and is intended to clarify the information handled by the
HNA and the various settings to be done.

DM may be configured with the following parameters.
These parameters are necessary to establish a secure channel between the
HNA and the DM as well as to specify the DNS zone
that is in the scope of the communication:

* DM: The associated FQDNs or IP addresses of the
DM. IP addresses are optional and the FQDN is
sufficient. To secure the binding name and IP addresses, a DNSSEC
exchange is required. Otherwise, the IP addresses should be entered
manually.

* Authentication Method: How the HNA authenticates itself to the
DM. This MAY depend on the implementation but this
should cover at least IPsec, DTLS and TSIG

* Authentication data: Associated Data. PSK only requires a single
argument. If other authentication mechanisms based on certificates are
used, then HNA private keys, certificates and certification authority
should be specified.

* Public Authoritative Server(s):  The FQDN or IP addresses of the Public
Authoritative Server(s). It MAY correspond to the data that will be set
in the NS RRsets and SOA of the Homenet Zone. IP addresses are optional
and the FQDN is sufficient. To secure the binding between name and IP
addresses, a DNSSEC exchange is required. Otherwise, the IP addresses
should be entered manually.

* Registered Homenet Domain:  The domain name used to establish the secure
channel. This name is used by the DM and the HNA for
the primary / secondary configuration as well as to index the NOTIFY
queries of the HNA when the HNA has been renumbered.

Setting the Homenet Zone requires the following information.

* Registered Homenet Domain: The Domain Name of the zone. Multiple
Registered Homenet Domains may be provided. This will generate the
creation of multiple Public Homenet Zones.

* Public Authoritative Server(s): The Public Authoritative Server(s)
associated with the Registered Homenet Domain. Multiple Public
Authoritative Server(s) may be provided.

Two possible methods of providing the required information would be:

JSON for forward zones
should be standardized in a similar way to zone file layout in RFC1035

DHCP for reverse zones
needs a separate draft
